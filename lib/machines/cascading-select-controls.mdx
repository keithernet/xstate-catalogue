# Cascading Select Controls

It is common to have a form with a set of select controls where one selection drives the values in the following select.
If the first selection is changed, the following select controls are reset/disabled.

## The pattern

When the machine is started it is in the <State>awaitingFirstSelection</State> state. When the user selects a value the <Event data={{value: 1}}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event> event
is triggered with the selected value. This sets the selection in the context
and the options for the second select are loaded based on the value of the first event. This completes with <Event data={{values: [4,5,6]}}>done.invoke.fetchSecondOptions</Event>
 and the machine enters <State>firstSelected.awaitingSecondSelection</State>. The pattern is repeated to an arbitrary depth.

When the machine is in <State>firstSelected.awaitingSecondSelection</State> it will respond to either another <Event data={{value: 2}}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event>
which will trigger another request to load the second set of options or the user may make a selection from the second
control triggering <Event data={{value: 4}}>SECOND_SELECTED</Event>. As above this updates the context and also triggers
the load of the third set of options. This completes with <Event data={{values: [8, 9, 10]}}>done.invoke.fetchThirdOptions</Event> and moves the machine to <State>firstSelected.secondSelected.awaitingThirdSelection</State>.

Again, the machine will respond to selections in previous controls (<Event data={{value: 1}}>FIRST_SELECTED</Event> or <Event data={{value: 4}}>SECOND_SELECTED</Event>).
It will also respond to <Event data={{value: 9}}>THIRD_SELECTED</Event> which is the final selection in this machine and
moves the machine to <State>firstSelected.secondSelected.thirdSelected</State>.
